# Android Project - Curs JEDI 2018

Small Android Studio project made by me in early 2018.

The app consists of the following functionalities:

* Login
* Calculator
* Memory Game
* Music Player
* Database
  * User/Password
  * User/Score

I used the [math parser library](https://github.com/mariuszgromada/MathParser.org-mXparser) by _mariuszgromada_ in the Calculator module to ease up mathematical expression recognition.
